This elevated momentum has recently stabilized, with activity now described as broadly unchanged in the near term. Regional heterogeneity has been noted, with varying intensities reported across West, East, Central, Southern, and North Africa, influenced by seasonal factors, population mobility, and co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens. Public health guidance and vaccination efforts have been ongoing. While reporting cadence and occasional access constraints have been noted, the overall data indicates a shift from the previous increase toward a current steady state, with recent observations suggesting a declining trend is beginning to emerge.",1,"{'past': {'direction': 'rising', 'severity': 'pronounced', 'slope_z': 2.227071580133245}, 'fluctuation': {'volatility_level': 'medium', 'smoothness': 'mixed', 'vol_z': 0.5408251858240369, 'r2_linear': 0.6198443493431183, 'diff_z': 0.6796014874413298}, 'near_term': {'direction': 'steady', 'severity': 'mild', 'delta_z': -0.0681892624757005}, 'future': {'direction': 'falling', 'severity': 'moderate', 'slope_z': -1.008156996130527}}"
